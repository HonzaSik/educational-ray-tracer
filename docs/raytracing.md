## What is Ray Tracing?
Ray tracing is a rendering technique used in computer graphics to simulate how light interact with objects in scene. Often used to create high quality images with realistic lighting, shadows, reflections, and refractions. 

## Key Concepts


## Basic Terminology
- **Ray:** A line that represents the path of light as it travels through space.

## Physical Principles
- **Snell's Law:** - Describes how light bends or refracts when it passes from one medium to another with different refractive indices.
